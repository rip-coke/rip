      On June 25th, Kenya watched its bravest fall. Young, unarmed, and full of dreams, they stood at the frontlines
      demanding a better tomorrow. In the face of injustice, they marched—not for fame, not for power, but for a
      future they could believe in. They held nothing but placards and hope. For their voices, for daring to speak,
      they were silenced by bullets.
    </p>
    <p class="py-2">
      Their blood waters the soil of a freer Kenya. Their voices echoed through tear gas, their names now etched in
      the conscience of a nation. Their sacrifice is a solemn call: we must not look away.
    </p>
    <p class="py-2">
      They were students, artists, daughters, sons—lives just beginning. Now, they are names we must never forget.
      Kenya must never forget the price the youth paid for truth.
