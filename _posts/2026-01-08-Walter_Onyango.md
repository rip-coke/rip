<p class='py-2'>
Walter’s talents were wonderfully diverse: he was a gifted sportsman on the field, a compelling actor on stage, and possessed a remarkable flair for languages. Yet, beyond all these achievements, he was best known as a loyal and unwavering friend—someone whose word was an unbreakable bond.  
</p>

<p class='py-2'>
Walter Allan Odhiambo Onyango spent his formative years moving between the nurturing embrace of Siaya and the vibrant pulse of Nairobi, a dual heritage that shaped his grounded yet ambitious character. From an early age, he naturally assumed the role of a guide and inspiration, not only to his immediate brother and sisters but also to his cousins and every child in the extended family circle. He led by quiet example, becoming a steadfast role model whose integrity and conduct lit a path for others to follow. 
</p>

<p class='py-2'>
His innate humility was perfectly paired with a brilliant and organised mind, which secured him the top position in his class throughout his schooling. Walter’s talents were wonderfully diverse: he was a gifted sportsman on the field, a compelling actor on stage, and possessed a remarkable flair for languages. Yet, beyond all these achievements, he was best known as a loyal and unwavering friend—someone whose word was an unbreakable bond. This unique combination of brilliance, talent, and reliability inspired deep trust in his family, who consistently turned to him as their selfless leader and natural ambassador, sending him to negotiate on their behalf whenever a need arose. 
</p>

<h1 id="edu" class="font-playfair pt-6 mb-4 text-2xl font-extrabold leading-none text-gray-900 md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl dark:text-black">Education</h1>


<p class='py-2'>
Walter started his early primary school education at St. George’s School (1981 – 1989), where he sat for and passed his Kenya Certificate of Primary Education very well. 
</p>

<p class='py-2'>
He later joined St. Mary’s Boys High School, Yala, from 1990 to 1993, where he sat for his Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education and earned top marks. 
</p>

<p class='py-2'>
He later joined Strathmore College, where he pursued a Degree in Programming and eventually studied a Bachelor of Science in Medicine at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (BELGIUM). 
</p>

<p class='py-2'>
Walter was a very good footballer, an award-winning actor during drama festivals and fluent in French and Dutch. 
</p>

<h1 id="mar" class="font-playfair pt-6 mb-4 text-2xl font-extrabold leading-none text-gray-900 md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl dark:text-black">Marriage & Family Life</h1>

<p class='py-2'>
The late Walter met the love of his life, Vivianne, in high school during drama festi vals held in 1992 and began dating in 1995. They have been together for over 30 years but were officially married in September 1998 at the Attorney General’s cham bers and were blessed with 2 boys. They were happily married for 27 years until Walter passed away on 24th December 2025. 
</p>

<h1 id="car" class="font-playfair pt-6 mb-4 text-2xl font-extrabold leading-none text-gray-900 md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl dark:text-black">Career and Enterprise</h1>

<p class='py-2'>
Walter's professional journey was one marked by dedication, expertise, and steady growth. He began his career in 1999 at SWIPCO (Swiss Procurement Company), where he served as an Inspector, Price Analyst, and Supervisor of Price Input Analysis. Following the company's transition to ICS (Inspection and Control Services), his talent and commitment were recognised with a promotion. From February 2003 to 2015, he contributed significantly to ICS Ghana, first as the Reporting Manager for the Quality Assurance Department and later rising to the position of General Manager. 
</p>

<p class='py-2'>
His quest for new challenges led him to pursue international opportunities. From December 2015 to 2018, he worked as a Freelance Consultant with Agility Fanar Trading FZE in Angola. Upon his return, he continued to apply his strategic skills as the General Marketing Manager for Royang Trading Company Ltd., a role he held from January 2019.
</p>

<p class='py-2'>
Alongside this, he embraced his entrepreneurial spirit and a lifelong passion for mechanics by establishing and managing the Capybara Garage. Walter’s work at his garage was more than a business; it was a reflection of his character. He loved to get his hands dirty, solving complex mechanical puzzles with the same analytical mind he applied in his corporate roles. His curiosity was boundless—he would eagerly research engines, determined to learn everything he could about how they worked. This blend of intellectual rigour and practical skill, of corporate leadership and hands-on craftsmanship, defined a professional life built on a foundation of relentless learning and genuine passion. 
</p>

<h1 id="att" class="font-playfair pt-6 mb-4 text-2xl font-extrabold leading-none text-gray-900 md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl dark:text-black">Attributes</h1>

<p class='py-2'>
Walter's interests painted a vivid picture of a man who embraced life with energy, curiosity, and deep connection. 
</p>

<p class='py-2'>
He was a passionate fan of football, sharing in the collective thrill of the game, and his love for automobiles was far more than a hobby—it was a hands-on passion that saw him happiest solving puzzles under the hood, his curiosity driving him to learn everything about the engines he worked on. 
</p>

<p class='py-2'>
This same hands-on spirit extended to the land, where he found peace and purpose in farming, tending to the earth with the same patience and care he applied to all his endeavours. Above all, Walter cherished his time with family and friends. 
</p>

<p class='py-2'>
He was a true social soul who believed in the warmth of togetherness, whether hosting gatherings, enjoying lively conversations, or simply sharing quiet moments. 
</p>

<p class='py-2'>
He loved the storytelling magic of movies, often getting lost in a good film. These moments of connection, laughter, and shared experience were the bedrock of his happiness, revealing a man whose greatest joy was found in the company of those he loved. 
</p>

<h1 id="dea" class="font-playfair pt-6 mb-4 text-2xl font-extrabold leading-none text-gray-900 md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl dark:text-black">Death</h1>

<p class='py-2'>
The life of Walter was tragically cut short on Wednesday, the 24th of December, 2025. 
</p>

<p class='py-2'>
He passed away following a fatal road traffic accident, a sudden and profound loss that has left an irreplaceable void in the hearts of all who knew him. The shock of his passing, coming on the eve of Christmas, has compounded the grief for his family and friends, marking this time with a deep and poignant sorrow. 
</p>

<p class='py-2'>
His sudden departure is a wound that will take a long time to heal. We are comforted only by the faith that he is now at rest, free from pain, and in the gentle embrace of eternal peace. 
</p>

<p class='py-2'>
While we grapple with the heartbreaking circumstances of his passing, we choose to focus not on how he died, but on the full and meaningful life he lived—a life of dedication, love, and integrity that will forever be his true legacy.

<h1 id="wife" class="font-playfair pt-6 mb-4 text-2xl font-extrabold leading-none text-gray-900 md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl dark:text-black">Wife's Tribute</h1>

<p class='py-2'>
Where do I begin? Tributes The Most Loving, Kindest, Honest, Straightforward (hated cutting corners), Diplomatic Person… Made sure The Boys and I lacked for nothing…. My Boo, My Bestie, My Buddy, My World. He used to call me Boo. (Boo, can we do this, Boo can we do that?) I will forever miss that. No more, “Boo, akelo chiemo so that we eat together.” He was big on that, the eating together thing, because after work hours, now he gets to tell me what challenges he faced with a certain car owner or an engine of a particular car, even when I knew mostly nothing about cars, I knew the basics and offered my 2Cents. I was always his sounding board. Such a Social Butterfly, extreme Extrovert. Alikuwa Mtu wa Watu handsdown. Greets anybody and everybody, reads strangers on the road. 
</p>
<p class='py-2'>
Children & Babies really gravitated towards him, calling him Uncle Walter or Uncle Water because some couldn’t pronounce his name properly. Always ready to offer assistance to anyone who needed it. Did not matter what he was doing. Going above and beyond to make sure to do what he said he would do. We were together-together, where you saw one, you definitely knew the other is not too far away. Whether Physically or Spiritually. We knew each other’s thoughts more often than not. We gossiped about everything and anything under the sun. We tried our level best to align Our Plans. To be on the same page on ALMOST everything. On some things, we always compromised. 
</p>
<p class='py-2'>
Nothing was perfect, but we both loved hard. He was extremely proud of his Boys (Shawn & Allan). That’s the one thing he vowed that he would make sure they get their education and have them situated first before ANYTHING ELSE! That is why, we as their Parents made sure to selflessly forego a lot of luxuries or projects (like building our permanent rural home). So, when Our Eldest Son came to us and said that he would finally be going to his own place, Walter was super happy and proud of himself, that now, from next year, we could start on these projects that have been in the making. He said, “Next year I turn 50 and an almost empty nester, so Boo, what’s next for Us?” “We can go on that honeymoon we’ve been putting off all those years. “We can prepare Our Passports and start travelling again. He thanked me too often this past year for choosing him, for loving him, being there for him and for spending the 30 years with him. But ALL these plans meant nothing, as God had His Own plans. That is why it is said that Man’s mind plans his way, but the LORD directs his steps and establishes them. I will forever miss My Person, My Imperfectly Perfect Person. He was PERFECT just for Me… Rest Easy, My Boo! Ik hou van jou… 143Lots!

<p class='py-2'>
My father. A man who meant so much to so many and everything to me. He was a man of quiet strength, wisdom and love. He showed us what it meant to be responsible, to care for family and to keep going even when life was hard. To me, he was not just my father but my guide, my mentor, my protector, my example...
</p>
<p class='py-2'>
The lessons he taught me- through his words and his actions- are lessons I will carry for the rest of my life. Though he is no longer with us physically, his values, his love, and his spirit live on in us. Dad, thank you for everything you gave us. You are deeply loved, deeply missed, and never forgotten. Rest peacefully.

So many words left unsaid. So many plans and dreams left unfinished. So many moments now meant to never be. You were more than just a father to me, but a friend and close confidant. You took my hand and showed me the way, even when I couldn’t see the solutions myself. How bitter-sweet it is to experience such an unorthodox friendship, only to have it cut so short. We would always joke about how we would write our own eulogies so that nothing was left out. I hope you felt seen and loved by us all. I hope you always felt appreciated . I will never forgetyour patience. Your hardwork and dedication. How you would call me “Chogo.” i will never forget you. I still wait to hear you knock at my door late at night to call us for dinner. I love you.
