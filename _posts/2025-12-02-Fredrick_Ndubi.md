        <p class='py-2'>
            Fredrick began his education at Gionseri DEB Primary School in 1960, completing his CPE examinations in 1967. He proceeded to Kisii High School in 1968 and later sat for the EAEC in 1971.
            His passion for service led him to join the Kenya Navy at Mtongwe, Mombasa, in 1972 as a ship technician. Through discipline, dedication, and exemplary work ethic, he rose through the ranks to become a Warrant Officer 1—a position he served with honour until his retirement. His commitment to the Navy remains a legacy deeply respected by all who worked with him.

            We gather today to celebrate the extraordinary life of our father and grandfather, a man whose journey was defined by duty, intellect, and unwavering strength. His was a life anchored by service to his nation and lifted by the power of education.

        <p class='py-2'>
            For many defining years, our patriarch answered the call of his nation, serving with distinction in the Kenya Navy. The sea was his second home, and the principles of naval service: discipline, dedication, and teamwork: became the very fabric of his character. He faced the challenges of the open ocean with the same courage and precision he brought to every aspect of his life. His time in uniform instilled in him a profound sense of duty and a respect for order that he carried into our family, making him a steadfast and reliable pillar for us all. He did not just serve; he embodied the loyalty and commitment required to protect our sovereignty.

        <p class='py-2'>
            Long before he sailed the high seas, his journey of excellence began on solid ground at Kisii High School. This foundational chapter was where he honed his intellect and developed the rigorous mindset that defined his later success. The competitive spirit and thirst for knowledge he gained there fueled his achievements both in his naval career and in his civilian life. Kisii High did not just educate him; it forged the keen mind and disciplined spirit that allowed him to excel and lead. He was living proof that a strong educational beginning is the compass for a fulfilling life.

        <p class='py-2'>
            One of our most treasured memories is how Grandpa would gather us around and share stories from his days in the Navy. His eyes always lit up as he described the sound of the waves crashing against the ship, the friendships forged at sea, and the courage it took to be far from home for months at a time and stories of Italy and The United Kingdom. He told those stories not to boast, but to teach us about discipline, resilience, and service. We would sit there wide-eyed, hanging onto every word, proud that our grandfather had sailed oceans with such strength and honour. Those moments, his voice soft but steady, his smile warm, and his heart full, are memories we will carry with us forever.
