Celebrating the Life of David Ithali Mbiti. A beloved son, father, colleague, and friend
</p>
<p class='py-2'>
  

</p>
<p class='py-2'>

We gather here today with heavy hearts, yet with gratitude for a life that, though tested by great trials, was lived with dignity, perseverance, and quiet strength.

</p>
<p class='py-2'>
We are here to celebrate and honour
the life of David Ithali Mbiti, born on 8th
November 1977, a beloved son, father, colleague, and friend.
</p>
<p class='py-2'>
  
David was born to Mrs Elizabeth Karamburi and the late Mr Erastus Mbiti, who laid the foundation of values that shaped the man David became. 
</p>
<p class='py-2'>
From an early age, it was evident that David was a child of promise: curious, disciplined, and determined to make something meaningful of his life.

</p>
<p class='py-2'>
<h1 id="edu" class="font-playfair pt-6 mb-4 text-2xl font-extrabold leading-none text-gray-900 md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl dark:text-black">Educational Journey</h1>

<p class='py-2'>
His educational journey reflects both resilience and adaptability. He began his schooling at Wanja and Kim Kindergarten, where his early character was shaped, before proceeding to Park Road Primary School. 
  </p>
<p class='py-2'>
  
Later, he transferred to Makini School, a transition that marked his ability to adjust and thrive in new environments. 

</p>
<p class='py-2'>

David went on to attend Kanyakine High School, where he continued to grow intellectually and socially, before
pursuing higher education at Methodist University. 
</p>
<p class='py-2'>

His academic journey was not merely about certificates, but about building the discipline and perspective.
</p>

<h1 id="prof" class="font-playfair pt-6 mb-4 text-2xl font-extrabold leading-none text-gray-900 md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl dark:text-black">Professional Life</h1>


<p class='py-2'>
Those who worked alongside him knew him as dependable, thoughtful, and quietly 2 committed to excellence. 
</p>
<p class='py-2'>

He did not seek praise, but his work spoke for him.
</p>

<h1 id="father" class="font-playfair pt-6 mb-4 text-2xl font-extrabold leading-none text-gray-900 md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl dark:text-black">A Father's Love and Courageous Battle</h1>



<p class='py-2'>
Above all, David was a father. He loved his children: Moses, Michael, Mitchell, and
Abigael, with a depth that words can scarcely capture. 
</p>
<p class='py-2'>
They were his greatest joy and his
strongest motivation. Even during difficult seasons, his thoughts were anchored on their
future, their wellbeing, and the values he hoped to pass on to them: integrity, resilience, humility, and faith in God.
</p>

<h1 id="courage" class="font-playfair pt-6 mb-4 text-2xl font-extrabold leading-none text-gray-900 md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl dark:text-black">Five Years of Courage</h1>


<p class='py-2'>
In 2020, David fell ill, beginning a long and courageous battle with sickness. For five years, he fought with remarkable endurance, demonstrating strength not just of body, but of spirit. 
  </p>
<p class='py-2'>
  
Through pain, uncertainty, and exhaustion, he held on with courage that inspired everyone around him. On 9th December 2025, at 3:00 am, David peacefully rested, marking the end of his earthly journey and the beginning of eternal rest.
</p>
<p class='py-2'>

David's life reminds us that strength is not always loud, and courage is not always dramatic.
</p>
<p class='py-2'>

Sometimes, it is found in simply showing up each day, enduring quietly, and loving faithfully despite hardship. He leaves behind a legacy of perseverance, responsibility, and love, especially in
the lives of his children, who will forever carry his name and values forward.
</p>

<h1 id="legal" class="font-playfair pt-6 mb-4 text-2xl font-extrabold leading-none text-gray-900 md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl dark:text-black">A Legacy That Lives On</h1>


<p class='py-2'>
As we mourn his passing, we also give thanks for having known him. We thank God for the years we shared with David, for the lessons his life taught us, and for the memories that will remain alive in our hearts.
</p>
  
<h1 id="life" class="font-playfair pt-6 mb-4 text-2xl font-extrabold leading-none text-gray-900 md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl dark:text-black">A Life Well Lived</h1>


<p class='py-2'>
May his soul rest in eternal peace, and may his family find comfort in knowing that
David Ithali Mbiti lived a meaningful life and fought a good fight. His story does
not end here; it lives on in all of us who loved him.
</p>
