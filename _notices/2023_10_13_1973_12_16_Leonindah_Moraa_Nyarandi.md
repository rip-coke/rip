<p></p><p>I lost o precious part of me A bond that spanned a liferime Came abruptly to an end. When my heart is feeling lonely. You won't answer when I call, And when I start to lose my balance, You can't catch me if I fall. I won't have your volce of reason When I start to lose my way Or your reassuring words of strength When I'm feeling so afrald. I will treasure all those good old days, All thase secrets that we shared, So that carefree girl I was with you Won t completely disappear. NI hold tightly to your memory And forever miss you so And I will gently let you go Tribute from Cecilia Nyaboke.</p><p></p><p>Where you once dwelled, dear Leanindch</p><p></p><p>But I'll trust that God must need you more,</p>
