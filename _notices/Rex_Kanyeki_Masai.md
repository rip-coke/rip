    On June 25th, 2024, Rex Kanyike Masai died a hero. He was called a modern-day martyr. But he was also an artist, an empath, a dreamer, budding architect, and the firstborn son to Gilian Munyao and Chrispin Odawa.

    On the night he died, the name Rex Masai spread in whispers across the country. Then the voices grew louder. Boiling in anger. Demanding justice for Rex. Many Kenyans wept for Rex that night. But none as bitterly as Gilian.

    Rex was 29, and only 1 week away from his maiden voyage to the UK, where he had just landed a job as casino staff. Weeks before he was shot dead, Rex had sent a copy of the acceptance letter to his mum. He promised her that, very soon, he would be loaded enough to move the family away from the slums.

    His passport was processed and ready for collection at Nyayo House. It remains unclaimed to this day.

    Born and raised in Dandora, Rex took to life not unlike his mother, with a hard swing, straight chin and stubborn determination. When Rex was born, Gilian says he came out swinging; staking his claim upon the world, loudly and boldly. But he always carried good tidings in his little balled fists.

    While Gilian worked odd jobs to keep the family afloat, Rex developed an interest in art, scored highly in math, and loved to draw. By the time he completed high school, Rex was set on a career in architecture.

    In his 3rd year of campus he was forced to defer his studies due to financial burdens. Not one to wallow, Rex moved out of his mother's nest, choosing to live with friends, diving headlong into bachelorhood, bent on making a name for himself.
</p>

    First he worked at a posho mill, then he got a series of casino gigs around Hurlingham and Westlands. Every payday, he would send money to his mum. A few days later, in true Rex fashion, he would call back and ask for fare—a quirk that always made Gilian smile. To his younger siblings—Wesley and Alicia—Rex's selflessness was unbounded, for he took his firstborn duties in stride.
</p>
<p class='py-2'>
    Whenever the casino gigs dried up and things got hard for Rex, Gilian would suggest he move back home. But Rex stood his ground, often saying, "Mum mimi sirudi. Wacha nijikaze nifunzwe na dunia."
</p>
<p class='py-2'>
    It was perhaps that same steely resolve which led Rex to the streets on that June day in 2024, when he lent his voice to the struggle for a better country and paid for it in blood.
</p>

    In life and death, Rex Masai always came out swinging.
</p>
<p class='py-2'>
    He will be sorely missed.
