    By the time he was 15, Brian Kasaine was making 700 shillings per day as a farm hand. His arms were certainly strong enough to dig his allocated plot of land, and still have enough manpower left over to help his workmates with their portions.
</p>
<p class='py-2'>
    He was born in Narok, the second-born son of Mary Nyanchoka and Justus Nyayo. By that time his older brother, Kelvin Morara, was a strapping boy of 4. Their brotherly bond bloomed into friendship, partnership, mentorship, and beyond.

    Kelvin would grow to admire Brian's enterprising spirit; his "kazi ni kazi" attitude towards life and work. Brian had no qualms about working at mjengo sites as a mason. He dreamt of making it big in business. In turn, Kelvin imprinted a deep sense of patriotism in his small bro.
</p>
<p class='py-2'>
    One day, while Kelvin was flat broke, Brian challenged Kelvin to join him in farm work. This wasn't Kelvin's ideal kind of work. You could say Kelvin was simply not digging it. But he badly needed the money.

    That morning they packed tea and mandazi. And off they went, jembes on their shoulders. They were each allocated Â¾ acre plots. Brian finished his section. As it turned out, no amount of mandazi was enough for Kelvin to complete his allocated plot. Brian offered to help. But it would cost Kelvin 200 bob. Among many things, Brian Kasaine was also a shrewd businessman.

    They bantered plenty. And Kelvin will always miss Brian's laugh.

    For high school, Brian attended St. Peters Nyakemincha Secondary School, where he scored a B+ in KCSE. When the results were announced, Kelvin felt a swarm of pride in his small bro. But Brian had one more surprise up his sleeve: A few months later, Brian bought a bike for his bodaboda business. Sometimes Brian and Kelvin would go on rides around Narok town, and they would occasionally zoom past Narok Police Station.
</p>
<p class='py-2'>
    They didn't know that, on the 25th of June, 2024, Brian would be shot dead meters away from the same station while exercising his constitutional right to protest.
</p>
<p class='py-2'>
    Kelvin witnessed Brian's final moments, and he carries the bitter memory like a load on his shoulders. The absence of Brian in their family has brought much darkness, confusion and heartache.
</p>

    Brian died at 19. He was set to join Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science & Technology in a few months.
