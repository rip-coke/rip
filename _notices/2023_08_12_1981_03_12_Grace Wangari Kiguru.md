Just know I'll never forget you. 
This isn't a permanent goodbye. 
Sometimes I sit and wonder If you are standing by my side, Giving me the courage To carry on with pride. 
I'll hold onto our memories, Until this life is done. 
Where we can be as one. 
Rest in peace, 
grandmother. 

Tribute from Grace Kinuthia.
It's okay to miss you,
It's okay to cry.
In my heart is where I'll store them,
